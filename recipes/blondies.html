        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>White chocolate and raspberry blondies</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>170g butter</li>
            <li>225g brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>210g plain flour</li>
            <li>150g white chocolate chunks</li>
            <li>50g fresh or frozen raspberries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180 C (350 F) standard / 160 C (320 F) fan-forced. Grease and line an 8-inch square baking pan with baking or parchment paper, ensuring two sides overhang.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add melted butter and sugar and gently whisk together. Add the vanilla extract and egg and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in flour and white chocolate chunks. Fold in raspberries. Pour the batter in prepared pan, smooth the top and place in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake blondies for approximately 30 minutes or until golden on the edges and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Leave in pan to cool completely. Cut into squares to serve.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fudge factor:</strong> Some reader feedback has been that these blondies are too fudgy and undercooked in the middle. That's just how I like them. But you can add 35 grams (1/4 cup) of extra flour for a more sturdy, cookie-like blondie.</li>
        </ul>
